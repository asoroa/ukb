ukb needs boost version 1.44 or higher to compile. Specifically, UKB needs the
following Boost libraries:

      * boost graph library
      * boost program options 
      * boost filesystem
      * boost tokenizer
      * boost lexical cast
      * boost numeric conversions
      * boost asio

* Compiling boost

If you have a linux distribution, just install the packages for boost
development. However, if you want to compile the boost libraries yourself, there
are some steps you can follow. This would install boost version 1.54. The files
will be installed into the /usr/local directory:

$ mkdir /tmp/boost_src
$ cd /tmp/boost_src
$ wget http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/boost/boost/1.54.0/boost_1_54_0.tar.bz2
$ tar xjf boost_1_54_0.tar.bz2
$ cd boost_1_54_0
$ ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=graph,system,filesystem,program_options,regex
$ sudo ./b2 install --layout=system
$ cd
$ rm -fr /tmp/boost_src

* Compiling UKB

If you have installed boost following the reciple above, just do the following:

$ cd src
$ ./configure --with-boost-include=/usr/local/include
$ make

the ./configure script has some options (./configure --help to see them
 all). The important options are:

#  --prefix
#             path were the executables will be installed (after 'make
#             install')
#
#  --with-boost-include
#            path were the Boost include files reside (default is
#            /usr/include)
#
#  --with-boost-lib
#            path were the Boost library files reside (default is /usr/lib)
#
#  --enable-static
#            Enable static linkage

After ./configure, just do a typical 'make'
